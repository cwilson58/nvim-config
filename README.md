# NVIM Config

This repo stores just my nvim config now being targeted towards my current professional goals for web development. This means I am focusing on technology in Vercel.

## Future TODO

- [] Yaml help somehow
- [] K8s, Docker, etc.
- [] Git without leaving nvim
- [] Install Scripts

I use `Space` as my leader key currently. It feels right.
