# NVIM Config
This is currently following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d12RCPgCe4U&t=2949s&ab_channel=David) tutorial for a windows setup on NVIM. I have not tested my config outside of a windows environment.

The package manager used by this tutorial is Paq, not sure of its advantages and disadvantages. Sounds like if I want to the same multi-language setup as I am leaving behind in vscode, I am going to want to use Lazy instead. further research is needed.
