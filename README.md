# NVIM Config
This is currently following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d12RCPgCe4U&t=2949s&ab_channel=David) tutorial for a windows setup on NVIM. I have not tested my config outside of a windows environment.

The package manager used by this tutorial is Paq, not sure of its advantages and disadvantages. Sounds like if I want to the same multi-language setup as I am leaving behind in vscode, I am going to want to use Lazy instead. further research is needed.

## Current nvim plugings
1. Lazy.nvim (package manager)
2. rose-pine (theme)
3. telescope
4. telescope-ui-select
5. treesitter
6. mason
7. mason-lspconfig
8. nvim-lspconfig
9. markdown-preview

## Non NVIM software
1. [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (package manager)
2. [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-US&gl=US) (optional)
3. ripgrep (required for telescope)
